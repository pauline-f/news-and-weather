## News and Weather

This is a web application that allows users to view news for a given country, and the weather of a given city.

### Client
I used React and functional components to create this SPA. The settings are saved in local storage.

### Server
I used:
- Node.js and Express,
- News API (https://newsapi.org/),
- Open Weather (https://openweathermap.org/).
